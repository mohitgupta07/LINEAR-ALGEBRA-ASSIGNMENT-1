problem 2-third
So instead of row operation we have to use column operations.
We can simply imply that column operation on A == row operation on A^T.
now, let's say if A' exists for A. Then we have to prove that (A^T)' exists for A^T.
Since we know that transpose and inverse are interchangable so (A^T)'==(A')^T.
Now if A' exists so (A^T)' will also exist.
This also proves that if we perform only column operations then too we can get inverse of A.


Bonus:-

Take Switch and mulADD.

where we convert the pivot element to 1 by using mul. we can simply do by muladd.
We want to convert x into 1:-
1=x+ a.x 
a= (1-x)/x

The other way to solve is to use mulADD and scale only.
With these two operations we can perform all the three operartions.
consider two rows r1 and r2 , along with two operations mulADD and scale we need to prove that we can perform the switch instruction.
perform these operations on the chosen rows:
	r1=r1+r2;
	r2=r1-r2; 
	r1=r1-r2;
After performing these operations we can clearly visualize that the values in the rows gets interchanged , hence switch operation is performed.
